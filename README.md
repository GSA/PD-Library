# Position Description Library

_This project has been archived, no further updates are planned at this time._

## About

For large organizations; it can be difficult to manage all of the positions available as well as information around that position (pay grade etc.). It can also be difficult to organize the information to help determine business hierarchy, and position category. Many organizations leverage spreadsheets or paper forms to maintain this information, which can cause confusion because of the inability to easily report on or find position information.

The Position Description Library (PD Library) is a simple tool that stores position descriptions across the enterprise. The tool allows those in HR position classification to create and maintain position descriptions, and allows read-only users, primarily managers and HR Specialists, to search for and view PDs. The application consists of a single form that captures all information related to a PD.

Please note, this application does not come with Position Descriptions that are already filled out, this is simply a means for storing them.
